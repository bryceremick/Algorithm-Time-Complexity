# Sort Algorithm Time Complexity
A program written in C++ to analyze the time complexity of different sort algorithms.

Overview:
---
This program runs each sort algorithm 100 times on each type of array. The average times and standard deviations are then calculated.

Sort algorithms used:
---
  -Insertion Sort <br />
  -Selection Sort <br />
  -Bubble Sort <br />
  -Quick Sort <br />
  -Merge Sort <br />
  
Arrays used:
--
  -Sorted Array <br />
  -Shuffled Array <br />
  -Reversed Array <br />
  -10% Shuffled/90% Sorted Array <br />
